This directory contains a simple LaTeX template (PCI_LaTeX_40.tex) with appropriate definitions, environments, and commands placed in the preamble to convert the article document class into a format that mimics the format that is used by Elsevier for the Proceedings of the Combustion Institute. The sample text provides additional descriptions and instructions. 

LaTeX manuscripts submitted for the 40th International Symposium on Combustion should be formatted using this template so that the editors and reviewers can quickly and efficiently make assessments regarding figure legibility and paper length. Using this format the maximum allowed paper length is nine pages, with the main text starting at the top of page 3.

Files included in this directory are:

README.txt       - This file.
PCI_LaTeX_40.tex - LaTeX template.
PCI_LaTeX.bib    - BibTeX-formatted references.
pci.bst          - Bibliography style file.
engine.png       - Sample figure file.
rho_T.jpg        - Sample figure file.
PCI_LaTeX_40.pdf - The resulting pdf file. 

This template was originally developed by Joe Oefelein for submissions to earlier Symposia. It was modified for submissions to the 39th Symposium, then updated for submissions to the 40th Symposium, by Dan Haworth. Updates for the 40th address some issues raised by authors using the 39th template, and accommodate the new information that is required for submissions to the 40th. It has been developed using MiKTeX 23.5/TeXworks (pdfLaTeX+MakeIndex+BibTeX); see https://miktex.org. It also has been confirmed to work using Overleaf (https://www.overleaf.com).
